## What is a CMS?

A **Content Management System (CMS)** is software that lets you manage your website content without writing code.

**Think of it like:**

- **Content editors** to update content through a user-friendly interface

### Objection Handling

**Objection 1: "Sounds complicated"**

Response:
> "I understand - 'CMS' sounds technical. But think of it like logging into Facebook to post an update. It's actually easier than Microsoft Word. We provide training, and you'll be comfortable using it within an hour."

---

**Objection 2: "I don't have time to learn"**

Response:
> "Fair point. Here's the thing: learning takes 1-2 hours. But updating content through us takes 30-60 minutes each time you need something changed, plus waiting days for us to do it. After your 3rd update, you've already saved time. Plus, you can make urgent changes instantly."

---

**Objection 3: "Seems expensive"**

Response:
> "Let's do the math. Content updates through us cost 500-1,000 DKK each. Most clients need 10-15 updates per year. That's 5,000-15,000 DKK annually. A CMS is [X] DKK one-time, then you can make unlimited updates for free. It pays for itself in less than a year."

---

**Objection 4: "What if I break something?"**

Response:
> "Great question! Three safety features: First, you can't break the design or code - you're only editing content. Second, we can restore any previous version if needed. Third, you can preview changes before publishing. It's actually very hard to break anything."

---

**Objection 5: "I'll still need you anyway"**

Response:
> "You're partly right - but for different things. Instead of paying us for simple text updates, you'll work with us on strategic improvements: new features, design updates, SEO campaigns. We become your strategic partner instead of your content editor. That's a better use of our expertise and your budget."
