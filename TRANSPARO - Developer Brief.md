- AI-assisted development + expert design
- 2-4 week delivery timeline

**Core Message (English):**  
Transparent pricing. Zero surprises. Projects that actually finish when promised.

## OUR 3 BIGGEST DIFFERENTIATORS

### 1. Zero Scope Creep Guarantee
**The Problem We Solve:** 73% of web design clients experience scope creep - projects that keep growing without clear end dates.

**Our Solution:** Structured revision rounds (2-4 depending on package) with mandatory sign-offs at key milestones. After design approval, changes cost extra. Clear boundaries = projects that finish.

**Why It Matters:** This is our #1 competitive advantage. Emphasize this throughout the site.

### 2. AI + Expert Hybrid Model
**What It Means:** We use AI tools for efficiency (research, content drafts, code structure) but experts perfect everything.

**The Result:** Bureau quality delivered 3-5x faster than traditional agencies (2-4 weeks vs 8-16 weeks).

### 3. Fixed Price, Full Transparency
**The Promise:** One price. No hidden costs. No "just one more thing" charges.

**Why It Matters:** Builds immediate trust. Clients know exactly what they're getting.

## COMPETITIVE CONTEXT

**Market Landscape:**

| Competitor | Price | Delivery | Our Advantage |
|------------|-------|----------|---------------|
| DIY Builders (Wix) | 2-5k DKK/year | Self-built | Professional quality vs templates |
| Budget Agencies | 3-8k DKK | 1-2 weeks | Custom design vs templates |
| **TRANSPARO** | **9-28k DKK** | **2-4 weeks** | **Quality + Speed + No Scope Creep** |
| Premium Agencies | 50-150k DKK | 8-16 weeks | 80% cost savings, 3x faster |

---

## TECH STACK

**Framework:**
- Next.js 15.5.6 (App Router)
- Payload CMS 3.62.1
- TypeScript

**Hosting:**
- Vercel (hosting + serverless)
- Vercel Postgres (database)
- Vercel Blob Storage (images/media)

**Why This Matters:**
This tech stack enables our AI-driven development approach (Cursor/Windsurf). WordPress wouldn't work with our process. This is also why we can deliver faster and cheaper than traditional agencies.

---

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

**Primary Goals:**
1. Visitor immediately understands "zero scope creep" value prop
2. Clear pricing builds trust (no "contact for quote")
3. Easy to book discovery call
4. Professional appearance that matches our premium-but-accessible positioning
5. Fast, mobile-friendly experience

**Key Actions We Want:**
- Book discovery call (primary conversion)
- View package details
- Read about process
- Contact via form/email/phone

---

## IMPORTANT NOTES

**Scope Creep Messaging:**
This is our #1 differentiator - it should be prominent throughout:
- Homepage hero section
- Package page has full explanation
- Process page shows sign-off points
- Trust indicators ("0% scope creep incidents")

**Transparency Theme:**
Everything should reinforce transparency:
- Show exact pricing (not "from X DKK")
- Show exact timelines
- Show exact process
- Show what's included vs add-ons
- No hidden information

**Mobile-First:**
Most visitors will be small business owners browsing on phones. Mobile experience is critical.

**Danish Language:**
All content in Danish. Make sure special characters (æ, ø, å) work perfectly.

---

## CONTENT STATUS

**Ready:**
- Brand positioning ✅
- Package details ✅
- Process timeline ✅
- Value propositions ✅

**Not Ready Yet:**
- Team photos (placeholder for now)
- Portfolio case studies (coming later)
- Client testimonials (coming later)

**Use placeholders for missing content - we'll add real content after launch.**

---

## PRIORITY

**Build in this order:**
1. Homepage (most important - this converts visitors)
2. Package page (second most important - shows value)
3. Contact page (enables conversion)
4. Process page
5. About page
6. Portfolio (can be "coming soon" initially)
